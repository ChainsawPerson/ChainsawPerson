# Intro

## A little bit about myself

Hi! I'm Takis and I'm an [Electrical and Computer Engineer at NTUA](https://www.ece.ntua.gr/gr).

I have been fiddling around with computers for as long as I can remember and as a result, I became very interested in coding and creating my own works.
I began *pseudo*coding in grade school using Scratch and entered University with only a beginner level understanding of Python.
I have been playing games on the family computer since childhood and I have always been amazed and curious about the process behind the making of a game, 
which pushed me into making [my very own](#pre-uni-projects).

My hobbies include:
* Gaming
* Reading Manga
* Watching Anime
* Memes
* Learning about new things in:
    * Science
    * Technology
    * Entertainment

My [dream](https://www.creativeuncut.com/gallery-27/art/jbaasb-giorno-giovanna.jpg) is to become a Game Developer and create a successful and fulfilling game (or maybe even a franchise if I were to shoot for the stars).

My favorite game franchises are:
- [The Legend of Zelda](https://zelda.nintendo.com)
- [Dark Souls](https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/dark-souls)
- [Final Fantasy](https://na.finalfantasy.com)

And they are my main source of inspiration as a developer.

## Pre Uni Projects:

I took part in a coding competition on Scratch where I made my very first game:

[The Tale of the Brave Hero](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/305930412/)

I have been working on-and-off on a [more complete version of the game](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/317020095/) since then (on Scratch), but it is still far from completed.

## Uni Projects:

I have *yet* to publish a work of my own due to limited free time, but I have uploaded most of my Uni homework on multiple repos.
Feel free to check them out and [contact me](#socials) for any mistakes/advice/pointers.
